                    <h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
                    <p>All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at eRum 2016 are required to agree to the following code of conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout and expect cooperation in ensuring a safe environment for all.</p>
                    <h3>The short version</h3>
                    <p>The organizers of eRum and Poznan Univeristy of Economics and Business are dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone regardless of gender, gender expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of eRum 2016 participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, conference events, Twitter and other online media. eRum 2016 participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the eRum 2016 organizers.</p>
                    <h3>The long version</h3>
                    <p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual and or discriminatory images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
                    <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>
                    <p>Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.</p>
                    <p>Participants engaging in harassing behavior may be sanctioned in any way organizers deem appropriate, including expulsion from the conference without refund and providing details to partner institutions and events.</p>
                    <p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of eRum 2016 staff immediately.</p>
                    <p>eRum 2016 staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of eRum 2016. We value your attendance.</p>
